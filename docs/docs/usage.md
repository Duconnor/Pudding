# Example Usage

You can use Pudding as a C++ library, or you can use the provided Python binding. The overall API is designed to be as similar to Scikit-learn's as possible, so there should be no learning gap. To demonstrate the usage, I provide several examples. You can find examples of every supported algorithm in ```examples/```. Note you may need to install additional Python packages, depending on the example you choose to run.
